# Inverse Dynamics Modeling Using Deep Learning
This project demonstrates a deep learning–based inverse dynamics model implemented using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). 
The notebook explores model training, evaluation, and prediction behavior, and is inspired by recent research directions in 
robotics and embodied AI, including concepts discussed in NVIDIA’s Project GR00T.
