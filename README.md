# Inverse Dynamics Modeling Using Deep Learning
This project demonstrates a deep learning–based inverse dynamics model implemented using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). 
The notebook explores model training, evaluation, and prediction behavior, and is inspired by recent research directions in 
robotics and embodied AI, including concepts discussed in NVIDIA’s Project GR00T.
## Project Overview
Inverse dynamics modeling focuses on predicting the control actions or forces required to produce a desired motion or state change. 
Such models are widely used in robotics, control systems, and embodied AI to enable agents to interact effectively with their environment.

This project presents a deep learning–based approach to inverse dynamics using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). 
The notebook walks through data preparation, baseline evaluation, model training, and prediction analysis to demonstrate 
how neural networks can learn complex state–action relationships.
